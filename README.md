# LIFE-website

Health and well-being are two very crucial aspects for happy living, and now more than perhaps ever it has been challenging to find a healthy upkeep and balance of it in our lives. In recent times there have been increasing levels of self-reported stress and anxiety by communities in Melbourne, with many of the reports identifying the likely main cause as the recent pandemic or social media over-consumption and idealisation.

According to research done by a local council in Melbourne, the wellness industry itself has grown rapidly over the past few years. People are looking for ways to decompress, relax, and focus on mental wellbeing. In view of that, the local council would like to commence a digital wellness website known as LIFE (Living It Fully Everyday). The program on the website will manage stress and lead the user down the path of becoming a more mindful and productive individual.
